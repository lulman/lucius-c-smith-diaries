and ¾ gallons molasses

Total valuation $987.00
counting that made at 20  value 20 
and that made on the Half. my Half at 50 
pur gallon about Half I made was on
the Halves I Have sold to the Best of
my accounts 281 gallons.

I Have now on
Hand some over 7.00 seven Hundred gallons
to sell. I find  a very Large Loss by
shrinkage and other wayes. we Have at
several times lost considerable by forgetting
Barrells, Lending out and making customers
good, It is a new Buissness to most people
and we Have to cheat ourselves to Keep on
the right side of customs. I Have sold
perhaps over the abovve amount
considerable But that is all I could
finde  when making up my riturns
an this year we will be more caucious
and perhaps with the tax Law.
