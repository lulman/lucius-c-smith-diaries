                     <p rend="h3">
                        Mid-nineteenth-century Family Dynamics   
                     </p>
                     <p>In 1862, when Lucius Clark Smith penned this diary, he would have been a young man roughly 27 years of age.  Modern observers are 
                        apt to question the normalcy of a man this age residing at home with his father, mother, and seven younger siblings.  
                        Yet, in the context of mid-nineteenth century agricultural life, there is little abnormal about this living situation.
                     </p>
                     <p>Demographic historians provide ample data suggesting that the household configuration of the Smiths in the early 1860s was not unheard of.  
                        The Smith household, numbering nine individuals as of the 1860 Federal Census, was somewhat larger than the national average of six <bibl><ref target="Ancestry1860">1860 Census</ref></bibl>.  Rural 
                        families, however, were more likely to experience higher rates of fertility than those in more urban areas.  Moreover, five of these children
                        would have been under the age of 18 at the time of the census, so their residence at home is unsurprising <bibl><ref target="Easterlin">Easterlin, Alter, and Condran</ref></bibl>.
                     </p>
                     <p>To explain the continued residence of the three eldest sons well into their twenties requires an examination of contemporary understandings
                        of adulthood and familial relationships in agricultural settings.  Our modern understandings of the teenage years and young adulthood are 
                        largely by-products of the twentieth century and would have been unknown to those living in the 1860s.  Adulthood was vested not in a specific 
                        age-bracket, but in an understanding of status based on dependence or independence.  The nature of parent-child relationships on farms led to 
                        what we would think of as a protracted period of dependence, resting on the mutual obligations that existed between fathers and sons.  Fathers 
                        were obligated to provide a practical education for sons to ensure that they had prospects as they moved into adulthood; children were in turn 
                        bound to provide labor and obedience as long as necessary.  Quite often, sons labored on the family farm till at least the age of 21 or beyond, 
                        at which point, they would ideally establish themselves on nearby farms.  By the last quarter of the nineteenth century, however, increasing 
                        land scarcity had some sons staying on the family farm for longer periods of time.
                     </p>
                     <p>The alternative to establishing an independent farm near to home was often to escape agriculture altogether and take up an urban occupation.  
                        As industrialization and urbanization increased in the second half of the 1800s, farmers feared that their sons would leave the farm never to 
                        return.  Articles in magazines and newspapers gave voice to that fear.  One specifically provided advice to young men thinking of abandoning 
                        the family farm: 
                        <quote type="block">“Again, it is your duty to ‘Stick to the Farm;’ your father has already reached the meridian of life, and has commenced to 
                        descend the ‘western declivity.’  He has long looked forward to the day when he could relinquish the active labors of the farm to his son.  
                        To this end he has taken special pains to instruct you in all things connected with good husbandry, and now, when he needs you most, when 
                        he feels the infirmities of age creeping on, when he needs your aid, will you leave him to struggle on?” <bibl><ref target="BoysStick">"Boys, Stick to the 
                        Farm"</ref></bibl></quote>
                        Thus, by the end of the nineteenth century, more farmers focused on keeping at least one of their adult sons on the farm rather than seeing 
                        them flee the area when unable to become settled on a nearby farm of their own <bibl><ref target="Frank">Frank, 147</ref></bibl>.
                     </p>
                     <p>The period of dependency for young farming males most frequently ended upon one of the hallmark ritual passages into adulthood: marriage.  
                        As historian Stephen Frank notes, “Until a son came of age, married, and established an independent household, he labored primarily for his 
                        father rather than for himself” <bibl><ref target="Frank">Frank, 142</ref></bibl>. Again, demographic historians illustrate that the bachelorhood (and its 
                        corresponding state of home-residence) of Lucius Clark Smith was not anomalous for the time.  During the period of 1850 through the Civil 
                        War, the median age for native-born white men to marry was 26.6 for men (22.9 for women) <bibl><ref target="FitchAndRuggles">Fitch and Ruggles, 63</ref></bibl>.  At 27 in 1862, 
                        Lucius Clark Smith, as well as the rest of his twenty-something brothers, were well within the normal range to be unmarried and thus dwelling at home.  
                     </p>
                     <p>Perhaps the only thing abnormal about the Smith household was the degree to which Lucius was able to engage in his own economic operations.  
                        The establishment of his own mill on his father’s land indicates a degree of autonomy that places Lucius well on the way to independent adulthood.  
                        Without examining the will of Archibald Smith, it is difficult to precisely determine what the status of this land grant was, but likely it 
                        represented Archibald’s patrimony to Lucius: the father’s obligation to see the child set-up with some means of economic self-sufficiency during 
                        a time of declining land availability.  Whatever the case, it is clear that work done both on the farm and on Lucius’ mill operations were both 
                        family affairs.

                        Production of molasses from sorghum was a fairly new agricultural activity during the mid-nineteenth century. It had cultural and  economic implications. Several books published about farming during the nineteenth century describe the process in some detail. In History of Ohio Agriculture(1900) Charles William Burkett mentions that sorghum was one of the crops introduced to Ohio by the early settlers in the nineteenth century. In “Soils and Crops of the Farm,” George Espy Morrow, Thomas Forsyth Hunt observe, “Sorghum is the only agriculturally important plant which has been introduced into the United States since the American Revolution. It was introduced about 1845 from China and was widely distributed during the decade prior to the war between the states”(260).

                     John is Lucius Smith's second younger brother. Lucius refers to him throughout the journal, commonly 
                     in reference to labor shared by the brothers on family farm. John was particularly noted as helping 
                     Lucius with the labor on his well and his Mill. In the week of August 23rd 1862, Lucius also mentions 
                     that John was considering enlisting in the company that was presently raising, but expressed doubt
                     that he would actually commit. However, Lucius's prediction proved wrong within a year, as John and 
                     brother <persName>Newton</persName> both enlisted in June of 1863.

                     On 30th November, 1862, Lucius mentions that John Evans "and wife" are visiting. This is likely
                     a reference to John W. Evans, another farmer of Plain of Lucius's generation, and his wife Maria.
                     John Evans enlisted in the Union Army in June of 1863, alongside the Lucius's brothers,

                     meeting in Albany on 2 August 1862. During his trips to Columbus Lucius sees Gilbert 
                     Collins on at least two occassions seeking legal aid. On 9 August 1862 Lucius visits Collins
                     to put his property in his father's name "so that if I am drafed he can take and them Patent Right
                     men can stand off." In December Lucius notes that he found out he found out he was being sued by 
                     "those Patent right men" when Gilbert Collins wrote to the Clerk of the U.S. Court at Cleveland.  
                     It is the likely that Lucius is referred to the lawyer Gilbert G. Collins who was later elected
                     mayor of Columbus from 1879-1880. Collins lived in Plains Township with his parents, Andrew and
                     Mary Collins until their death. He relocated to Columbus to study law 1858 and was admitted to 
                     practice in March 1861.<bibl><ref target="#BEO19thcentury">"Collins, Gilbert G"</ref>;

                  there. On the week ending September 6th, Smith mentions that the Rebels under General Smith are advancing 
                  onto the city and that it has been put under martial law, along with neighboring towns. On the 12th, he
                  writes that thousands of people are going to Cincinnati to defend it, taking theirs guns, etc., and that 
                  the governor is already refusing people. Finally, on the week ending September 20th, Smith writes that
                  Cincinnati has been saved after "some of the severest fiting of the war." The trajectory of these events 
                  describe what has come to be known as the Defense of Cincinnati, about which the Editorial Introduction

                 <desc>John L. Gill, Sr. was a Columbus Tinner and one of the founding partners of the
                    Franklin Foundry. Gill took over sole proprietorship in 1852, then associated his son
                    with the business in 1857, taking the name "John L. Gill and Son" for the business. The
                    foundry was a major metal casting concern in Columbus in the 1850's and 1860's, specializing
                    in farm mechanism such as plows, mills and harvesters.
                    However, "John L. Gill and Son" is also a name associated specifically with sorghum production
                    in Ohio, being mentioned both in the first "Report of the Commissioner of Agriculture" to 
                    Congress in 1862 and the Ohio State Department of Agriculture report of the same year. While
                    both Gill Jr. and Sr. were both active in this aspect of the family business - both are
                    mentioned in the Sorgo Journal and Farm Machinist of 1865 - John L. Gill, Jr., the 
                    eponymous "and Son," seemed to have taken a more active role, being both the Secretary of
                    1862 and 1865 Ohio Sorghum Convention and appointed to a committee "to correspond with or visit
                    the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, and secure, if possible, some mitigation of the duty
                    proposed to be assessed on Sorghum."
                    Nor were the Gills slow to capitalize on the advantage that their duel family businesses provided.
                    In the 1862 Ohio Cultivator, Gill Jr. responds to criticism that the Ohio Sorghum Convention, 
                    of which he was the Secretary, was monopolized by "the inventors, manufacturers and agents of Mills
                    and Evaporators, and was made an advertising medium" for them.

            <p>This edition is the latest in a series of collaboratively produced electronic
               editions of previously unpublished nineteenth-century American manuscripts held in
               the Rare Books and Manuscripts Library at The Ohio State University. Previous
               editions include "My Dear Elizabeth," five letters written by Sophia Peabody
               Hawthorne to her sister Elizabeth Palmer Peabody between ca. 1837 and 1868 (currently
               being revised); "Dear Wife," twenty-one letters written by riverboat captain William
               B. Anderson to his wife Louisa while he plied the Ohio river during the height of the
               American Civil War, 1862â€“1864; "Journal of a Tour to Europe," by Samuel Sullivan Cox;
               and "Louisa A. Doane's Journal of Two Ocean Voyages (1852-1853). These documentary
               editions are intended to provide wide exposure and access to manuscripts that might
               otherwise be difficult for scholars to discover and consult, and to provide users
               with a variety of tools for studying those texts. </p>
            <p>Each text was edited in connection with an undergraduate or graduate course offered
               by H. Lewis Ulman, Associate Professor of English at The Ohio State University. The
               courses provide students with an opportunity to explore issues of textuality
               and mediation that arise when our cultural archives spread from page to screen and
               from library shelves to networked databases. Electronic textual editing serves as our
               vehicle for examining what happensâ€”and envisioning what might happenâ€”when artifacts
               in one medium are represented in another medium, especially with regard to the
               interpretive work of reading. Electronic textual editions also provide a contact zone
               that can help us reflect on what manuscript, print, and "born digital" artifacts can
               tell us about their unique properties and their relationships to one another.</p>
            <p>While providing a reliable textual edition is a <foreign xml:lang="lat">sine qua
                  non</foreign>, the Smith edition also explores ways of telling four stories
               inextricably woven into our work: the lives and historical milieu evoked by the
               texts, the history of the physical journal (including its recent restoration), the
               editorial process that gave rise to this particular interpretation of the text, and
               the mediation of our electronic delivery system. </p>

               <emph rend="bold">Scanning</emph>. The manuscript pages were scanned as 24-bit TIFF
               images at 400 dots per inch (dpi), then coverted to 8-bit JPEG images at 400 dpi and
               full quality before being loaded into the Media Manager application. All edges were
               overscanned by at least 1/4 inch. No color correction was used at any stage of image
               preparation, but a scan of a photographer's 18% grey card on the same scanner
               produced RGB values at the center of 91/95/107 after applying a 150% Gaussian Blur in
               Adobe Photoshop to average color values. Thus, a properly configured monitor should
               provide a reasonable approximation of colors on the manuscript pages.

               <emph rend="bold">Markup of Physical Structure and Page Layout</emph>. The manuscript
                  <emph rend="bold">pages</emph>, encoded by the empty page break or &lt;pb/&gt;
               element, are the primary physical structures represented in the markup. Each
               &lt;pb&gt; element includes a &quot;facs&quot; attribute identifying the unique ID of
               a high-resolution scan of that image in the Media Manager application. <emph
                  rend="bold">Line breaks</emph> (i.e., lineation determined or influenced by the
               physical constraints of the page rather than compositional choices by the author) are
               encoded with the empty &lt;lb/&gt; element. No attributes are included in the
               &lt;lb&gt; element. 
            </p>
            <p>
               <emph rend="bold">Markup of Textual Structure</emph>. The <emph rend="bold">diary
                  entry</emph>, encoded by a &lt;div&gt; element with the attribute-value pair
               &quot;type='Entry'&quot;, constitutes the primary textual structure represented in
               the markup. Each entry contains a
               &lt;dateline&gt; element and one or more paragraphs. Each dateline may include a
               &lt;name&gt; element with (optionally) a @type attribute containing one of
               the following values: city, region; and a &lt;date&gt; element with a
               @when attribute whose value is in the form YYYY-MM-DD. The value of the
               @when attribute represents the editors' judgment about the actual date when the entry
               was composed; the contents of the &lt;date&gt; element represent what Smith actually
               wrote, even if he entered the date incorrectly.
            </p>
            <p>
               Entries consist of a series of <emph rend="bold">paragraphs</emph>. Where indicated
               by context, indentation of a line from the left margin of a page, line breaks part-way across
               a page, or additional white space between lines, paragraphs are encoded with the
               &lt;p&gt; element and no attributes.
            </p>
            <p>
               If present, any prefatory text preceding the dateline may be encoded as a
               &lt;head&gt; element at the beginning of an entry (i.e., within the
               &lt;div&gt;element and before the &lt;dateline&gt;).
            </p>
            <p>
               <emph rend="bold">Level of Transcription/Encoding</emph>. This markup scheme supports
               a modest range of presentations, from semi-modernized/corrected to semi-diplomatic.
               The basic transcription follows the manuscript verbatim. Various manuscript features
               (e.g., cancellations, interlinear or marginal additions, tears in pages) are encoded,
               as are regularized versions of proper names and dates and standard versions of
               nonstandard spellings and expansions of abbreviations. </p>

               <note resp="ed" xml:id="Fits">In the mid to late nineteenth century, fits could refer to any number of 
                  mental, physical, or moral problems.  Essays on morality frequently referred to “fits of passion,” 
                  where the fits represented inappropriate, even sinful, behavior.  It is more likely, however, that 
                  Lucius was alluding to a physical or mental condition of “falling fits” or “nervous diseases” such 
                  as epilepsy.  A medical understanding of epilepsy existed by this time, though its causes and 
                  treatment remained open to much speculation. <bibl><ref target="evangelist">"The Boy who had 'Fits'"</ref><ref target="medical">"Westminster Hospital"<ref target="Ohio medical"></ref></ref></bibl></note> getting Better

                  In context, this could only refer to a trip by rail; Worthington and Delaware were consecutive stops
                  on the branch of the New York Central Railroad that connected Columbus with Cleveland. What is less clear
                  however, is whether this refers to buying a ticket on the Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati Roalroad that
                  provided passenger service between the two cities, or simply getting a ride on a freight train passing 
                  through. However, if we accept historical averages of price per mile for the region at this time, the trip
                  would likely cost 45 to 50 cents per man, and this at a time when average daily income was near 80 cents. Given 
                  Smith's usual cost-consciousness, it is unlikely he or Goodrich would have paid so much to ride the 15 miles from 
                  Worthington to Delaware when they were willing to walk the same distance from New Albany to Worthington earlier 
                  in the same day.
