               Monday George 
               Goodrich and me went and to uncle
               
               Lewises and staid all night walked over
               nice walking. Tuesday morning went over
               to Worthington and then by the cars<a name="pCars" class="notePointer"></a><a href="#nCars" class="annotation" title="In context, this could only refer to a trip by rail; Worthington and Delaware were consecutive stops on the branch of the New York Central Railroad that connected Columbus with Cleveland. What is less clear however, is whether this refers to buying a ticket on the Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati Roalroad that provided passenger service between the two cities, or simply getting a ride on a freight train passing through. However, if we accept historical averages of price per mile for the region at this time, the trip would likely cost 45 to 50 cents per man, and this at a time when average daily income was near 80 cents. Given Smith's usual cost-consciousness, it is unlikely he or Goodrich would have paid so much to ride the 15 miles from Worthington to Delaware when they were willing to walk the same distance from New Albany to Worthington earlier in the same day."><sup class="noteAnchor">4</sup></a>

               pick a man and Let them settle It for 
               us. Saturday Morning Mr. Wilson &amp; I
               went down to Squire Martins in Jeferson
               TP. to meet Garret. He was there but
               failed to Bring His man as He said He
               was sick. But I guess He did not want to
                settle it as some one Has put a new
               Idea into His Head that He could come
               under the Head of a Borrowed Horse and
               get all Damages. while under a Hired Horse
               He must loose all. He now sayes He

               Down from 75$ to 50$ I offered His $30 [.00?]

         <h2>Explanatory Annotations</h2>
         <p class="hang15"><a name="nFits"></a>1.&nbsp;In the mid to late nineteenth century, fits could refer to any number of 
            mental, physical, or moral problems.  Essays on morality frequently referred to “fits
            of passion,” 
            where the fits represented inappropriate, even sinful, behavior.  It is more likely,
            however, that 
            Lucius was alluding to a physical or mental condition of “falling fits” or “nervous
            diseases” such 
            as epilepsy.  A medical understanding of epilepsy existed by this time, though its
            causes and 
            treatment remained open to much speculation. ("The Boy who had 'Fits'""Westminster Hospital")<a href="#pFits" class="annotation">

         <p class="hang15"><a name="nMaryland"></a>2.&nbsp;Smith is here referring to the Maryland Campaign, wherein contemporary sources describe
            Confederates crossing the 
            Potomac River, invading Maryland, and taking over the city of Frederick on September
            7, 1862 ("Invasion"). This led to the Battle of 
            Antietam on September 17th, considered today to be one of the major turning points
            in the Civil War, wherein Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan led the Army of the 
            Potomac to a decisive victory, forcing Gen. Robert E. Lee to order a withdrawl across
            the Potomac on September 18th. A September 20, 1862, dispatch from the Headquarters
            
            of the Army of the Potomac states, "The name given to this battle is the Antietam. After our forces occupied the whole
            field, 
            the rebel loss was found to be far greater, particularly in killed, than was at first
            supposed. Fully two thousand five hundred were found lying on the field,
            while a larger number had been buried the day before by their friends. Their loss
            in killed and wounded men will not come far from
            eighteen thousand to twenty thousand" (qtd. in "Retreat").<a href="#pMaryland" class="annotation">

               </a></p>
         <p class="hang15"><a name="nHorse"></a>3.&nbsp;Lucius Smith's use of the word "Horse," in the context of 
            his mill, usually refers to "horsepower." Horsepower, as it is understood today, 
            is a unit for measuring power. The engines that drove sugar mills in the 1860s 
            could have various range of horsepower: "an engine of 20 horse-power will drive 
            a sugar mill having rollers 5 feet long and 28 inches diameter...An engine of 18 horse-power
            
            will work a mill 4 ½ feet long and 26 inches diameter..." (Brande and Cox 643). Smith's truncation 
            of horsepower to "horse," which was a familiar usage in the nineteenth century (see Bourne 501), 
            draws attention to the analogy of the output of steam engines with the power of horses
            that informed 
            the unit of measurement.<a href="#pHorse" class="annotation">

            In context, this could only refer to a trip by rail; Worthington and Delaware were
            consecutive stops
            on the branch of the New York Central Railroad that connected Columbus with Cleveland.
            What is less clear
            however, is whether this refers to buying a ticket on the Cleveland, Columbus and
            Cincinnati Roalroad that
            provided passenger service between the two cities, or simply getting a ride on a freight
            train passing 
            through. However, if we accept historical averages of price per mile for the region
            at this time, the trip
            would likely cost 45 to 50 cents per man, and this at a time when average daily income
            was near 80 cents. Given 
            Smith's usual cost-consciousness, it is unlikely he or Goodrich would have paid so
            much to ride the 15 miles from 
            Worthington to Delaware when they were willing to walk the same distance from New
            Albany to Worthington earlier 
            in the same day.
