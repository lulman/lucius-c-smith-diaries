            <p>This edition is the latest in a series of collaboratively produced electronic
               editions of previously unpublished nineteenth-century American manuscripts held in
               the Rare Books and Manuscripts Library at The Ohio State University. Previous
               editions include "My Dear Elizabeth," five letters written by Sophia Peabody
               Hawthorne to her sister Elizabeth Palmer Peabody between ca. 1837 and 1868 (currently
               being revised); "Dear Wife," twenty-one letters written by riverboat captain William
               B. Anderson to his wife Louisa while he plied the Ohio river during the height of the
               American Civil War, 1862–1864; "Journal of a Tour to Europe," by Samuel Sullivan Cox;
               and "Louisa A. Doane's Journal of Two Ocean Voyages (1852-1853). These documentary
               editions are intended to provide wide exposure and access to manuscripts that might
               otherwise be difficult for scholars to discover and consult, and to provide users
               with a variety of tools for studying those texts. </p>
            <p>Each text was edited in connection with an undergraduate or graduate course offered
               by H. Lewis Ulman, Associate Professor of English at The Ohio State University. The
               courses provide students with an opportunity to explore issues of textuality
               and mediation that arise when our cultural archives spread from page to screen and
               from library shelves to networked databases. Electronic textual editing serves as our
               vehicle for examining what happens—and envisioning what might happen—when artifacts
               in one medium are represented in another medium, especially with regard to the
               interpretive work of reading. Electronic textual editions also provide a contact zone
               that can help us reflect on what manuscript, print, and "born digital" artifacts can
               tell us about their unique properties and their relationships to one another.</p>
            <p>While providing a reliable textual edition is a <foreign xml:lang="lat">sine qua
                  non</foreign>, the Smith edition also explores ways of telling four stories
               inextricably woven into our work: the lives and historical milieu evoked by the
               texts, the history of the physical journal (including its recent restoration), the
               editorial process that gave rise to this particular interpretation of the text, and
               the mediation of our electronic delivery system. </p>

               •	If you employ image files, describe how they were produced and note where they are stored.
               •	Describe any editorial guidelines you followed (e.g., how you treated hyphenation, whether 
                  you corrected apparent errors, and any other decisions about how to treat recurrent features).
               •	Describe any special symbols that you use in your text to indicate additions, corrections, 
                  cancellations, and so on. This important explanation provides a reader's guide to the text.
               
                  You can use more than one paragraph (tagged <p> </p>).

                  might include screen shots of the edition running on various systems as a step

               <emph rend="bold">Scanning</emph>. The manuscript pages were scanned as 24-bit TIFF
               images at 400 dots per inch (dpi), then coverted to 8-bit JPEG images at 400 dpi and
               full quality before being loaded into the Media Manager application. All edges were
               overscanned by at least 1/4 inch. No color correction was used at any stage of image
               preparation, but a scan of a photographer's 18% grey card on the same scanner
               produced RGB values at the center of 91/95/107 after applying a 150% Gaussian Blur in
               Adobe Photoshop to average color values. Thus, a properly configured monitor should
               provide a reasonable approximation of colors on the manuscript pages.

               <emph rend="bold">Markup of Physical Structure and Page Layout</emph>. The manuscript
                  <emph rend="bold">pages</emph>, encoded by the empty page break or &lt;pb/&gt;
               element, are the primary physical structures represented in the markup. Each
               &lt;pb&gt; element includes a &quot;facs&quot; attribute identifying the unique ID of
               a high-resolution scan of that image in the Media Manager application. <emph
                  rend="bold">Line breaks</emph> (i.e., lineation determined or influenced by the
               physical constraints of the page rather than compositional choices by the author) are
               encoded with the empty &lt;lb/&gt; element. No attributes are included in the
               &lt;lb&gt; element.

               <emph rend="bold">Markup of Textual Structure</emph>. The <emph rend="bold">diary
                  entry</emph>, encoded by a &lt;div&gt; element with the attribute-value pair
               &quot;type='Entry'&quot;, constitutes the primary textual structure represented in
               the markup. Each entry contains a
               &lt;dateline&gt; element and one or more paragraphs. Each dateline may include a
               &lt;name&gt; element with (optionally) a @type attribute containing one of
               the following values: city, region; and a &lt;date&gt; element with a
               @when attribute whose value is in the form YYYY-MM-DD. The value of the
               @when attribute represents the editors' judgment about the actual date when the entry
               was composed; the contents of the &lt;date&gt; element represent what Smith actually
               wrote, even if he entered the date incorrectly.
            </p>
            <p>
               Entries consist of a series of <emph rend="bold">paragraphs</emph>. Where indicated
               by context, indentation of a line from the left margin of a page, line breaks part-way across
               a page, or additional white space between lines, paragraphs are encoded with the
               &lt;p&gt; element and no attributes.
            </p>
            <p>
               If present, any prefatory text preceding the dateline may be encoded as a
               &lt;head&gt; element at the beginning of an entry (i.e., within the
               &lt;div&gt;element and before the &lt;dateline&gt;).

               <emph rend="bold">Level of Transcription/Encoding</emph>. This markup scheme supports
               a modest range of presentations, from semi-modernized/corrected to semi-diplomatic.
               The basic transcription follows the manuscript verbatim. Various manuscript features
               (e.g., cancellations, interlinear or marginal additions, tears in pages) are encoded,
               as are regularized versions of proper names and dates and standard versions of
               nonstandard spellings and expansions of abbreviations. </p>
