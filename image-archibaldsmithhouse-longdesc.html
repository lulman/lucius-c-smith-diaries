    <p>Undated black-and-white photograph of the Archibald Smith homestead showing the front and south sides of the house framed by trees in the foreground. The house is a plain, two-story, single-gabled, wood-frame design with two chimneys, one at each end. Two windows without shutters frame each side of the front entrance, with five similar windows on the second floor.  No shrubbery borders the house, and there is no front porch. A metal fence encloses the yard.</p>
