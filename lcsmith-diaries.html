         <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
         
         
         <p>In a short diary entry dated 2 August 1862,
            Lucius Smith, a 27-year-old farmer and sometime schoolteacher living near
            New Albany, OH with his parents and seven younger siblings, notes that he
            "Helped at Hay &amp; oats" half the day on his family’s farm, worries about his
            own sorghum operation, reports on a war meeting in New Albany, and refers to a
            discussion with a neighbor about a piece of farming equipment. What Smith's
            diary lacks in depth or analysis on any particular topic, it makes up for by
            revealing how diverse elements of rural culture in central Ohio during the
            Civil War weave into an individual life. No internal or external evidence
            suggests that Smith intended his diary to serve as anything other than a
            personal record. An account book, inventory, or personal almanac would
            likely exhibit more structure, but Smith blends those genres by recording
            business transactions, accounts of equipment, and comments on the weather
            with observations on a number of other recurring topics. Regarding the Civil
            War, Smith writes about the draft and appeals for enlistments at war
            meetings, arrests for treasonable language, news of battles and debates over
            slavery, and the fate of friends and acquaintances serving in the Union
            Army. Writing about work on his cane mill and his family's farm, Smith
            speaks of digging wells and hauling stone, brick, and wood. He describes
            equipment for farming, milling sorghum, making molasses, and he records
            details about the weather and the progress of his crops. Writing about the
            social life of his community, he speaks of helping one another with chores,
            attending parties, participating in hunting competitions, and listening to
            speeches and sermons. In sum, as we discuss in more detail below, Smith
            provides an eye-level view of diverse aspects of rural life and work in Ohio
            during the Civil War.

         <h3 id="family">
            Mid-nineteenth-century Family Dynamics   
            
         </h3>
         
         <p>In 1862, when Lucius Clark Smith penned this diary, he would have been a young man
            roughly 27 years of age.  Modern observers are 
            apt to question the normalcy of a man this age residing at home with his father, mother,
            and seven younger siblings.  
            Yet, in the context of mid-nineteenth century agricultural life, there is little abnormal
            about this living situation.
            
         </p>
         
         <p>Demographic historians provide ample data suggesting that the household configuration
            of the Smiths in the early 1860s was not unheard of.  
            The Smith household, numbering nine individuals as of the 1860 Federal Census, was
            somewhat larger than the national average of six (1860 Census).  Rural 
            families, however, were more likely to experience higher rates of fertility than those
            in more urban areas.  Moreover, five of these children
            would have been under the age of 18 at the time of the census, so their residence
            at home is unsurprising (Easterlin, Alter, and Condran).
            
         </p>
         
         <p>To explain the continued residence of the three eldest sons well into their twenties
            requires an examination of contemporary understandings
            of adulthood and familial relationships in agricultural settings.  Our modern understandings
            of the teenage years and young adulthood are 
            largely by-products of the twentieth century and would have been unknown to those
            living in the 1860s.  Adulthood was vested not in a specific 
            age-bracket, but in an understanding of status based on dependence or independence.
            The nature of parent-child relationships on farms led to 
            what we would think of as a protracted period of dependence, resting on the mutual
            obligations that existed between fathers and sons.  Fathers 
            were obligated to provide a practical education for sons to ensure that they had prospects
            as they moved into adulthood; children were in turn 
            bound to provide labor and obedience as long as necessary.  Quite often, sons labored
            on the family farm till at least the age of 21 or beyond, 
            at which point, they would ideally establish themselves on nearby farms.  By the last
            quarter of the nineteenth century, however, increasing 
            land scarcity had some sons staying on the family farm for longer periods of time.
            
         </p>
         
         <p>The alternative to establishing an independent farm near to home was often to escape
            agriculture altogether and take up an urban occupation.  
            As industrialization and urbanization increased in the second half of the 1800s, farmers
            feared that their sons would leave the farm never to 
            return.  Articles in magazines and newspapers gave voice to that fear.  One specifically
            provided advice to young men thinking of abandoning 
            the family farm: 
            “Again, it is your duty to ‘Stick to the Farm;’ your father has already reached the
            meridian of life, and has commenced to 
            descend the ‘western declivity.’  He has long looked forward to the day when he could
            relinquish the active labors of the farm to his son.  
            To this end he has taken special pains to instruct you in all things connected with
            good husbandry, and now, when he needs you most, when 
            he feels the infirmities of age creeping on, when he needs your aid, will you leave
            him to struggle on?” ("Boys, Stick to the 
            Farm")
            Thus, by the end of the nineteenth century, more farmers focused on keeping at least
            one of their adult sons on the farm rather than seeing 
            them flee the area when unable to become settled on a nearby farm of their own (Frank, 147).
            
         </p>
         
         <p>The period of dependency for young farming males most frequently ended upon one of
            the hallmark ritual passages into adulthood: marriage.  
            As historian Stephen Frank notes, “Until a son came of age, married, and established
            an independent household, he labored primarily for his 
            father rather than for himself” (Frank, 142). Again, demographic historians illustrate that the bachelorhood (and its 
            corresponding state of home-residence) of Lucius Clark Smith was not anomalous for
            the time.  During the period of 1850 through the Civil 
            War, the median age for native-born white men to marry was 26.6 for men (22.9 for
            women) (Fitch and Ruggles, 63).  At 27 in 1862, 
            Lucius Clark Smith, as well as the rest of his twenty-something brothers, were well
            within the normal range to be unmarried and thus dwelling at home.  
            
         </p>
         
         <p>Perhaps the only thing abnormal about the Smith household was the degree to which
            Lucius was able to engage in his own economic operations.  
            The establishment of his own mill on his father’s land indicates a degree of autonomy
            that places Lucius well on the way to independent adulthood.  
            Without examining the will of Archibald Smith, it is difficult to precisely determine
            what the status of this land grant was, but likely it 
            represented Archibald’s patrimony to Lucius: the father’s obligation to see the child
            set-up with some means of economic self-sufficiency during 
            a time of declining land availability.  Whatever the case, it is clear that work done
            both on the farm and on Lucius’ mill operations were both 
            family affairs.

            Milling and Mill Operations   
            
         </h3>
         
         
         <p><strong>Farm Mechanization and Power in the Nineteenth Century</strong></p>
         
         <p>The explosion of farm mechanization that marked the 19th century, including the Sorghum
            mills that 
            Lucius Smith invested in, called for an equal increase in the rise of farm power to
            operate those new 
            mechanisms. Before this time, water-powered mills – almost exclusively flour mills
            and sawmills – had 
            been sufficient for most farmer’s needs, but not all of these new farm mechanisms
            could be conveniently 
            located close enough to a running water source to take advantage of water power. Instead,
            new farm 
            mechanisms embraced the idea of modular power, having a simple belt pulley by which
            power could be 
            delivered from any source.
         </p>
         
         <p>Chief among these new powers were animal power and steam power. However, as portable
            steam engines were 
            still a relatively new, and expensive, innovation – the first portable steam engine
            was patented in 1849 
            – farmers were much more likely to use animal power, horse power specifically. In
            a horse-power, a long 
            wooden beam, or “sweep,” was attached on one end to a horse’s harness and on the other
            end to the outside 
            of a main gear wheel. The horse would then be lead around the power, turning the main
            gear wheel and this 
            rotation was transferred through smaller gears and shafts to another belt pulley,
            which would drive the 
            belt, which would power the mechanism. This arrangement was not only cheaper and more
            proven than steam 
            power but gave the advantages of portability and flexibility of configuration that
            traditional water power 
            lacked. Further, the horse-power could be geared up or down to provide high-torque/low-speed
            or 
            low-torque/high-speed power to a variety of mechanisms.
         </p> 
         
         <p>Sorghum mills, even though they were relatively new innovations in the mid-19th century,
            were fairly simple 
            mechanisms, familiar to anyone who has ever seen an old-fashioned laundry mangle:
            two (or more) large steel 
            cylinders were situated very close together and rotated counter to each other. Cane
            was fed into the mill 
            and between these cylinders which squeezed the juice from the cane. Lucius C. Smith’s
            initial mill, with 
            which he is so preoccupied in the first half of this journal, is undoubtedly a horizontal
            mill, in which 
            the cylinders are placed horizontally and powered by a belt-pulley attached to a seperate
            horse-power. 
            However, the weaknesses of this system becomes apparent in Smith’s own account of
            his operations. Though 
            he had just gotten a new one turned on September 6th, the counter-shaft of his horse
            power broke on October 
            2nd, less than four weeks later, due to the sheer stress of the torque applied in
            night-and-day operations.
         </p>
         
         <p>Smith’s second mill, however, avoided this problem. The John L. Gill and Son No. 6
            Vertical Cane mill, which 
            Smith purchsed for $88 on October 3rd, had one central 12” roller and two secondary
            9” rollers arranged 
            vertically with an integrated horse power. This integrated horse power, two sweeps
            attached to the drive 
            shaft above the mill, obviated the need for the counter-shafts and tumble-shafts that
            would deliver power 
            from a separate horse-power and thus eliminated two potential points of failure in
            Smith’s previous arrangement.
            It is worth noting, however, that even with this new, more advanced mill, Smith had
            enough Cane supply in the 
            Autumn of 1862 that he continued using both mills simultaneously to keep up with the
            demand for his services.

            Sorghum and the Production of Molasses in Nineteenth Century Ohio
            <br>
            
         </h3>
         
         <p>
            Production of molasses from sorghum was a fairly new agricultural activity during
            the mid-nineteenth century. 
            It had cultural and  economic implications. Several books published about farming
            during the period 
            describe the process in some detail. In <cite>History of Ohio Agriculture</cite> (1900), Charles William Burkett 
            mentions that sorghum was introduced to Ohio by the early settlers in the nineteenth
            century. These early 
            settlers were interested in developing family farms. In <cite>Soils and Crops of the Farm</cite>, 
            George Espy Morrow and Thomas Forsyth Hunt observe, “Sorghum is the only agriculturally important plant 
            which has been introduced into the United States since the American Revolution...and
            was widely distributed 
            during the decade prior to the war between the states” (260).

         <p><strong>History and Technology</strong>
            <br>The Sorghum cane, which is supposed to be native to China, came to United States via
            France in the 1850s. Before the 
            introduction of sorghum, maple sap, juice from beet and sugarcane were used to produce
            sugar. However, those posed 
            specific difficulties to the country in which local industries were trying to find
            a national market: the sugar produced 
            from the other kinds of canes dried up fast. In Ohio, sorghum was initially raised
            in small scales and molasses made from 
            it were sold in local markets. In the Springfield market, for instance, molasses from
            sorghum were sold at 75 cents a 
            gallon at the outset. The Leffel sorghum mill at Springfield thrived during the 1860s.
            Its owner Joseph Leffel had two 
            acres of cane which he crushed using horse power. Some of Leffel's contemporary sorghum
            mill owners like Rev. Abraham 
            Myers harnessed the water of the Mad River for power (Prince 84-5). The standard 
            stages in making sorghum molasses included growing of sorghum cane, followed by grinding
            the cane at the Cane house 
            using horse power and then, boiling the juice in large vessels.

         <p>Mid-nineteenth century Ohio may have used more 
            large scale agricultural machines than any one state at the time (Documents, Messages... 504) . 
            The Steam Thresher and Sugar Mills were used for grinding sorghum. The latter was
            invented 
            around 1856-57 for specifically this purpose unlike the Steam Thresher which was used
            for grinding several other 
            kinds of grains. Both the Steam Thresher and the Sugar Mill helped cut down labor
            costs.
            Some late nineteenth century documents also state that the produced molasses were
            first taken home in large barrels 
            by the farmers and then, the rest was sold. Evidently, in the nineteenth century the
            sorghum industry was more geared 
            toward domestic rather than a large scale commercial enterprise for many mill owners.
            At the same time, the potential of 
            the industry to grow rapidly was recognized by farmers and mill owners.

         <p><strong>Commercialization</strong>
            
            <br>On 7th January 1862 a State Sorghum Convention was held at Columbus, Ohio. The convention
            not only discussed the culture 
            of growing sorghum and manufacturing molasses from it, but also promoted certain kinds
            of pans and mills as facilitators 
            of more profitable and durable products than others. <cite>The Ohio Cultivator</cite> documents a debate between a sales agent of 
            "Implements and Machinery," and the secretary of the convention on the subject of
            advertising at the 
            convention (Bateham and Sullivan 156-57). Interestingly, the same volume features a recipe called "Mr. Thorn's Sorghum Cake"
            
            which includes Sorghum molasses among its ingredients. Thus, the mid-nineteenth century
            agricultural culture in Ohio was closely related to the growing 
            acceptance and significance of sorghum molasses. However, the growth of the industry
            was slow over the decades in the state. 
            H. Talcott, a member of the Jefferson Sugar Manufacturing Company , presented a paper
            in the Agricultural convention recorded 
            in the Annual Report of the Ohio State Board of Agriculture (1883), to endorse the promotion of the sorghum-molasses 
            industry in Ohio: he proposed growing sorghum as a rotation crop with corn and charted
            
            its many uses which included preparation of sugar, cooking molasses, rum vinegar and
            prepared coffee.  Talcott's presentation is 
            prompted by the rather scattered nature of the sorghum industry till the 1880s 
            and "no very good results or much practical use made of the crop" (90).

         <p> Thus, Lucius Smith's investment in the Cane House, which surfaces in most of his
            journal entries from August to December 
            1862, represents a  relatively novel agricultural and industrial development in the
            state. Smith follows state-of-the-art 
            technologies for producing molasses. Furthermore, Smith's visit to different cities
            in search of the 
            right apparatuses for his mill is put into perspective by the history of the manufacturing
            businesses, 
            publicity and sales campaigns around the sorghum molasses industry in 1860s Ohio.

         <p><strong>The State of the Draft in Ohio</strong></p>
         Throughout the months of August and September Lucius Clark Smith expressed anxiety
         about the draft and referred to men volunteering out of fear of being drafted.
         On August 4, 1862, the Secretary of War, Edwin M. Stanton, issued an order to draft
         300,000 men into the military to serve for nine months. Although each state 
         was called to supply their required quota of men by the fifteenth of August, Ohio
         was granted repeated extensions due to the mounting pressure to provide regiments
         in the defense of its southern border. The draft was first postponed to September
         16 ("In Relation to the Draft") and then for a second time until October 1 
         ("Drafting Postponed").
         
         <p>
            During each postponement Ohio's Unionist governor David Tod encouraged citizens at
            large to voluntarily enlist. He also urged the commissioners responsible for 
            organizing the draft in their respective district to do likewise. It was during the
            first postponement that Tod encouraged the county commissioners directly to use 
            this time to recruit more regiments in order to fulfill Ohio's quota of 23,000 militia
            men through volunteers, "thereby sav[ing] the trouble, expense and vexation 
            of resorting to drafting in Ohio" ("In Relation to the Draft").
            
         </p>   
         
         <p>
            Just two days before the first postponement was set to end, Tod announced the second
            extension and concluded with an impassioned plea to Ohio's men to answer the call
            
            to service: "The necessity for the force called for by the President is now apparent to all. Our
            very firesides are threatened in the desperate efforts of the rebels 
            to destroy our glorious Government. Rally then, noble men of Ohio, and with the grand
            effort to fill up the ranks"("Drafting 
            Postponed"). Between September 15 and October 1, however, about 8,000 men voluntarily enlisted,
            which left some 12,000 still to be drafted. Thus, in spite of the
            Governor's efforts to solicit voluntary enlistment since the initial announcement
            of the draft in August, three-fourths of the counties in Ohio commenced the draft
            on the first 
            of October in order to meet their respective quotas ("The Draft in Ohio"). 
            
         </p>
         
         <p>
            While many counties and townships held meetings to encourage enlistment and "devis[e] ways and means to raise each town's quota and avoid the draft", the men of
            Ohio were clearly reluctant to voluntarily enlist ("How to Avoid a Draft"). Part of the difficulty in attracting volunteers was 
            attributed to the requirement in Ohio that volunteers provide three years of service
            rather than the nine months required of draftees. <cite>The Daily Cleveland Herald</cite>
            in late December of 1862 characterized the draft as a failure that "engendered much bad feeling in portions of the State, and has proved a slow process
            in filling up the Union 
            army rank and file" . The article concludes by suggesting, "The same effort and expenditure in enlisting
            nine months volunteers would have filled the muster rolls sooner and fuller" 
            ("The Draft a Failure"). For those counties who secured their full quota through voluntary enlistment, however,
            the increased service requirement 
            of the volunteers was held up as testimony to their collective patriotism - that they
            sent "three year soldiers" rather than "nine months [sic] men" ("The Draft 
            Over").

         <p><strong>Partisan Politics During War: the Arrest of Edson B. Olds and Opposition to the Draft</strong></p>
         Opposition to the 1862 draft seemed to have taken on a different character in contrast
         to the well-known opposition of 1863. Around the time of the Conscription Act of March
         1863, there was
         bitter opposition against the exemption which allowed for a wealthy draftee to hire
         an able-bodied substitute in his place. Such resistance appeared not to take such
         precedence a year earlier.
         A letter to the editor in 1862, written under the pseudonym "Justice," expressed specific
         outrage that state and county officers, deputies, and clerks were exempted from the
         draft altogether.
         The author asserts that "they are the only men in the State, (excepting contractors) who are making money,
         and consequently, if drafted, are better able to employ substitutes than any other
         class of individual in the State"  ("Editors Herald"). "Justice" did not, like his compatriots would a year later, single out wealthy Ohioans
         for criticism. 
         
         <p>
            In August of 1862, <cite>The Crisis</cite> accused a "Black Republican postmaster" of using his position to shield his three
            sons from the draft, instead of shouldering his nationalistic 
            duty to God and country ("Republicans Creeping Out of the Draft"). While such a criticism might have been legitimately leveled at Columbus' wealthy
            elite, several citizens instead chose to 
            aim their ire at Ohio's civil servants. This fit well with other examples of Democratic
            attacks toward Republicans. The <cite>Ohio Statesmen</cite> decried the practice of Pennsylvania and 
            New York, both of which postponed their drafts. The newspaper accused the two states
            of providing "fewer men to the war than the Democrats or Conservatives" (<cite>Newark Advocates</cite>). In both cases the 
            Democratic papers used the draft to critique Republicans' administration and avoidance
            of the draft without opposing the draft itself.  
            
         </p>
         
         <p>
            During 1862, those who openly criticized the draft were liable to be arrested for
            charges of disloyalty, treasonable language, and discouraging enlistment. One such
            notable arrest that is directly 
            referenced in Smith's diary is that of Edson B. Olds. Olds had served as a congressional
            representative from 1849 until his failed bid for re-election in 1854.Before the draft
            was officially announced 
            in August, Olds delivered a speech about the draft that eventually led to popular
            uproar and later to his arrest. In July, 1862, the <cite>Lancaster Eagle</cite> published a response from 
            Olds defending his speech. He claimed his views were misrepresented and that he was
            not discouraging men from enlisting. Rather, Olds argued he was only presenting a
            vision of what might happen should the Republicans
            institute a draft. He wrote, as long as the war focused on the "putting down of rebellion, and the 'maintenance of the Constitution as it is, and
            the Union as it was,' the Democracy would freely shed 
            their blood, and liberally give their money, but so soon as it ceased to be a war
            for the suppression of rebellion, and became an abolition war, no Democrat would be
            found willing to volunteer. I further 
            remarked: that the Government in all probability would make a draft for soldiers,
            and that drafting would be in the hands of Republicans; that the party would want
            to keep Republicans at home to vote, and 
            that no fair draft would be made; and that if any Democrat believed that he had been
            fraudulently drafted, he would refuse to go, and that a file of soldiers would be
            sent after him, and that under such 
            circumstances he would resist, even at the point of the boyonet [sic], and that in
            this way civil war would be brought upon us in Ohio. Not one word was said as advising
            resistance, but all was told as a
            vision of what would be future events"  ("Dr. Old's Vision").
            
         </p>
         
         <p>
            His defense, however, was ultimately ineffective. Olds was arrested for treasonable
            language later that month. On the one hand, local Democratic papers like <cite>The Crisis</cite> characterized 
            the arrest as "arbitrary" and as a "kidnapping" ("Arrest of Edson B. Olds"). On the other hand, Republican papers characterized Olds as a "notorious traitor"
            
            ("Dr E.B. Olds"). While imprisoned in Fort Lafayette, he was elected as a member of the State House
            
            of Representatives. <cite>The Daily Cleveland Herald</cite> attributed Olds' election to his arrest and imprisonment, stating that "the arrest and imprisonment of the notorious E.B. Olds has 
            resurrected him from what, otherwise would have been a final political sleep. . .
            . he fills a much larger space in the world behind the bars of a prison than he would
            in the open air"  (
            "Arrest and Imprisonment of the Notorious E. B. Olds"). 
            
         </p>
         
         <p>
            Smith wrote in his private diary that the arrest and imprisonment of  Dr. E.B. Olds
            manifested "considerable feeling" among the Democrats. Olds' arrest and the subsequent
            partisan squabble illustrate the contentious
            nature of politics during wartime. Discontent over the draft in 1862 served, like
            any other issue, as a divisive battleground for Ohio's politicians. Democrats used
            the draft and the imprisonment of predominantly 
            Democratic citizens to mount a trenchant critique of Republican administration of
            the government.

            Borderlands and Hinterlands: Cincinnati and the Ohio River During the Civil War  
            
         </h3>
         
         <p>
            Located just over 100 miles southwest of Lucius Clark Smith’s home, Cincinnati functioned
            as an important source of supplies and soldiers for 
            Union forces during the Civil War, a role largely consequent of its position on the
            Ohio River and its status as—in the words of one contemporary 
            newspaper—“the commercial emporium of the West” ("Field Operations"). These two facts are, of course, related: Cincinnati developed as a bustling city
            
            for trade largely because of the emergence during the 19th century of the steamboat,
            which made river trade a substantially less burdensome 
            undertaking in the region. Propelled by the development of railways—“By the eve of the Civil War, Ohio boasted some 3,000 miles of track, . . . 
            the most of any state in the entire nation” (Phillips)—Cincinnati became host to an influx of immigrants, particularly from Ireland and
            Germany. 
            By 1850 “47.2 percent of Cincinnatians were immigrants, and more than 70 percent came from
            either Ireland or Germany”(Phillips). 
            
         </p>
         
         <p>
            These immigrants tended to be Catholics, and, coupled with large swaths of transplanted
            southerners, they constituted a largely Democratic voting 
            bloc—one frequently opposed to the War and to emancipation. Contemporary sources reveal
            that at the root of this opposition lay unease about their 
            own security in a post-emancipation world: as a foreign observer touring Cincinnati
            in 1863 remarked, “The jealousy of the low Germans and Irish against the free negro 
            was sufficient to set them against the war which would have brought four million of
            their black rivals in competition for that hard and dirty work which 
            American freedom bestowed on them” (qtd. in Klement 100). Propagating this alarmist sentiment, Ohio Democratic Congressman Samuel Sullivan
            Cox, in a 
            speech published in the September 9, 1862, edition of the <cite>Daily National Intelligencer</cite>, stated, “The right and power to exclude Africans from the States 
            North, being compatible with our system of State sovereignty and Federal supremacy,
            I assert that it is impolitic, dangerous, degrading, and unjust to the 
            white men of Ohio and of the North to allow such immigration” ("Speech"). These feelings of dissent largely undergirded the more visible role Cincinnati played
            in 
            providing supplies and combatants.

         <p><strong>The Defense of Cincinnati</strong></p>
         
         <p>
            Throughout his entries for September, 1862, Lucius Clark Smith repeatedly makes reference
            to the goings-on in Cincinnati—later to be referred to as the 
            Defense of Cincinnati—whereby the city was threatened by Confederate forces. Contemporary
            sources paint a vivid portrait of the struggle. 
            
         </p>
         
         <p>
            The September 4, 1862, edition of the <cite>Milwaukee Daily Sentinel</cite> reports that, on September 1st, “[Confederate Major General] Kirby Smith’s army appeared 
            in the suburbs [of Lexington], and demanded the surrender of the city, which was complied
            with by the citizens” ("War in Kentucky"). With the Confederates having taken 
            Lexington, they prepared to mount an attack on Cincinnati; consequently, Union Major
            General Lew Wallace declared martial law and seized sixteen 
            steamboats to be armed. Wallace would organize residents of Cincinnati, Covington,
            and Newport for defense. The Sentinel reports that on September 2nd, 
            “Citizens are enrolling themselves rapidly in the different wards” and that “[t]he
            Forty-fifth and Ninety ninth Ohio are falling back slowly to Covington. . . . 
            All steamboats are ordered to remain on the Ohio side of the river. . . . Some apprehension
            is felt for our safety” ("War in Kentucky"). Indicative of this apprehension, 
            Cincinnati mayor George Hatch ordered all businesses closed.
            
         </p>
         
         <p>
            On September 3rd, Ohio governor David Tod announced—in a declaration printed in the
            city papers and telegraphed throughout the state—the need for men to 
            defend Cincinnati, stating that “all such bodies of men who are armed, will be received. They will repair at once
            to Cincinnati and report to Gen. Lew 
            Wallace who will complete their further organization” ("Noble Response"). The response was so overwhelming, however, that on 
            September 5th, Tod announced to the public that “no additional volunteers would be needed for the defense of Cincinnati” ("Noble Response").
            
         </p>
         
         <p>
            An account of the events that followed, published in the <cite>Cincinnati Gazette</cite>, reports that “On the 10th, it was ascertained that the rebels were within five miles of 
            the city, in force, under Gen. Heath [sic], and the Governor again called on the Minute
            Men to rally in defense of Cincinnati. On the 11th, they began to 
            pour in again . . . .” However, the sheer number of men defending Cincinnati made it invulnerable to attack,
            and “On the 13th, Gen. Wright telegraphed Gen. 
            Tod that the enemy was retreating, and not to send any more troops” (reprinted in "Noble Response").

            It is difficult to overestimate the  Ohio River's importance during the Civil War.
            As the southern border of Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio, the river served as a border
            
            between slave states and free states and functioned as an obstacle for Confederates
            attempting to cross over into the north. Contemporary sources reference gunboats 
            patrolling the river on a daily basis and also mention steamboats being used to transport
            Union troops throughout the region. Describing the fortifications being 
            erected in and around Cincinnati, one newspaper cites the river’s importance to the
            area’s defense: “The Ohio river, from Columbus to Sedamsville, forms the 
            segment of a circle, the length of the arc being nearly 12 miles, with a range of
            hills on the south of Covington and Newport for its base . . . completely commanding
            
            all the river and road approaches from the South” ("Defences").

         <p>
            
            <p>This edition is the latest in a series of collaboratively produced electronic
               editions of previously unpublished nineteenth-century American manuscripts held in
               the Rare Books and Manuscripts Library at The Ohio State University. Previous
               editions include "My Dear Elizabeth," five letters written by Sophia Peabody
               Hawthorne to her sister Elizabeth Palmer Peabody between ca. 1837 and 1868 (currently
               being revised); "Dear Wife," twenty-one letters written by riverboat captain William
               B. Anderson to his wife Louisa while he plied the Ohio river during the height of
               the
               American Civil War, 1862–1864; "Journal of a Tour to Europe," by Samuel Sullivan Cox;
               and "Louisa A. Doane's Journal of Two Ocean Voyages (1852-1853). These documentary
               editions are intended to provide wide exposure and access to manuscripts that might
               otherwise be difficult for scholars to discover and consult, and to provide users
               with a variety of tools for studying those texts. 
            </p>
            
            <p>Each text was edited in connection with an undergraduate or graduate course offered
               by H. Lewis Ulman, Associate Professor of English at The Ohio State University. The
               courses provide students with an opportunity to explore issues of textuality
               and mediation that arise when our cultural archives spread from page to screen and
               from library shelves to networked databases. Electronic textual editing serves as
               our
               vehicle for examining what happens—and envisioning what might happen—when artifacts
               in one medium are represented in another medium, especially with regard to the
               interpretive work of reading. Electronic textual editions also provide a contact zone
               that can help us reflect on what manuscript, print, and "born digital" artifacts can
               tell us about their unique properties and their relationships to one another.
            </p>
            
            <p>While providing a reliable textual edition is a <i>sine qua
                  non</i>, the Smith edition also explores ways of telling four stories
               inextricably woven into our work: the lives and historical milieu evoked by the
               texts, the history of the physical journal (including its recent restoration), the
               editorial process that gave rise to this particular interpretation of the text, and
               the mediation of our electronic delivery system. 
            </p>
            
         </p>
         <h3>Editorial Method</h3>
         
         
         
         
         <p>
            <strong>Scanning</strong>. The manuscript pages were scanned as 24-bit TIFF
            images at 400 dots per inch (dpi), then coverted to 8-bit JPEG images at 400 dpi and
            full quality before being loaded into the Media Manager application. All edges were
            overscanned by at least 1/4 inch. No color correction was used at any stage of image
            preparation, but a scan of a photographer's 18% grey card on the same scanner
            produced RGB values at the center of 91/95/107 after applying a 150% Gaussian Blur
            in
            Adobe Photoshop to average color values. Thus, a properly configured monitor should
            provide a reasonable approximation of colors on the manuscript pages.
            
         </p>
         
         <p>
            <strong>Production Location of Digital Assets</strong>. The TEI P5-encoded
            transcription of the Smith journal, along with XSL style sheets used to provide
            variant "views" of the edition, TEI ODD documents used to produce custom schemas
            based on the TEI markup language, and the resulting schemas are stored on a server
            hosted by College of Arts and Sciences at The Ohio State University and on a Google
            SVN repository. Readers may download copies of those source files via a link at the
            top of this page. High resolution scans of the manuscript pages, scans of plates from
            contemporary sources, and photographs of the journal are stored in the Media Manager
            application hosted by the College of Arts and Science at The Ohio State University.
            The files constituting the project's Web site are stored on a Web server hosted by
            the College (http://people.cohums.ohio-state.edu/ulman1/LCSmithDiaries/).
         </p>
         
         <p>
            <strong>Archiving of Digital Assets</strong>. Once the edition is complete,
            its digital assets will be archived in The Ohio State University
            Knowledge Bank (https://kb.osu.edu/dspace/). 
            
         </p>
         
         
         <h3>Encoding Conventions</h3>
         
         <p>
            <strong>Markup of Physical Structure and Page Layout</strong>. The manuscript
            <strong>pages</strong>, encoded by the empty page break or &lt;pb/&gt;
            element, are the primary physical structures represented in the markup. Each
            &lt;pb&gt; element includes a "facs" attribute identifying the unique ID of
            a high-resolution scan of that image in the Media Manager application. <strong>Line breaks</strong> (i.e., lineation determined or influenced by the
            physical constraints of the page rather than compositional choices by the author)
            are
            encoded with the empty &lt;lb/&gt; element. No attributes are included in the
            &lt;lb&gt; element. Because Smith wrote on lined paper, when he skips a line printed
            on the paper for any reason, we encode a &lt;lb/&gt; that, in the view arranged by
            manuscript pages and lines, will appear as an empty numbered line. 
         </p>
         
         <p>
            <strong>Markup of Textual Structure</strong>. The <strong>diary
               entry</strong>, encoded by a &lt;div&gt; element with the attribute-value pair
            "type='Entry'", constitutes the primary textual structure represented in
            the markup. Each entry contains a
            &lt;dateline&gt; element and one or more paragraphs. Each dateline may include a
            &lt;name&gt; element with (optionally) a @type attribute containing one of
            the following values: city, region; and a &lt;date&gt; element with a
            @when attribute whose value is in the form YYYY-MM-DD. The value of the
            @when attribute represents the editors' judgment about the actual date when the entry
            was composed; the contents of the &lt;date&gt; element represent what Smith actually
            wrote, even if he entered the date incorrectly.
            
         </p>
         
         <p>
            Entries consist of a series of <strong>paragraphs</strong>. Where indicated
            by context, indentation of a line from the left margin of a page, line breaks part-way
            across
            a page, or additional white space between lines, paragraphs are encoded with the
            &lt;p&gt; element and no attributes.
            
         </p>
         
         <p>
            If present, any prefatory text preceding the dateline may be encoded as a
            &lt;head&gt; element at the beginning of an entry (i.e., within the
            &lt;div&gt;element and before the &lt;dateline&gt;).
            
         </p>
         
         <p>
            <strong>Level of Transcription/Encoding</strong>. This markup scheme supports
            a modest range of presentations, from semi-modernized/corrected to semi-diplomatic.
            The basic transcription follows the manuscript verbatim. Various manuscript features
            (e.g., cancellations, interlinear or marginal additions, tears in pages) are encoded,
            as are regularized versions of proper names and dates and standard versions of
            nonstandard spellings and expansions of abbreviations. 
         </p>
         
         <p>
            
            <strong>Customization of the TEI P5 Schema</strong>. Customization consisted primarily of restricting
            encoding to certain modules and elements as well as enforcing some attribute values.
            See the ODD file for 
            complete details.

         <h2>Appendices</h2>
         <h3 id="peopleMentioned">List of People Mentioned in Lucius Smith's Diary</h3>
         <p><strong>Beach, Lewis</strong> (b. 1818).
            Smith mentions "Uncle" Lewis Beach sporadically throughout his diary, usually in reference
            to a visitation
            of some sort. For instance, Smith makes reference to spending the night at Lewis's,
            along with Homer, in early September. References
            like these indicate that Beach and Smith were close.
         </p>
         <p><strong>Bennet, Daniel Jr.</strong> (b. 1828).
            On 2 August 1862, Smith writes that he "went to see Mr.
            Bennit who has a horse power witch [sic] He sayes [sic] I can Halve[?]." Six days
            later, he reports that
            he looked at some other horse-powered winches, then engaged one of "Daniel Bennits."
            He may be referring to
            Daniel Bennet, Jr., whose father, Daniel Sr., settled "near the center of" neighboring
            Harlem Township, 
            Delaware County, Ohio, in 1809 and died there in 1861 "Daniel Bennet" [Sr.];
            "Daniel Bennet" [Jr.].
            
         </p>
         <p><strong>Brownlow, William Gannaway, 1805-1877</strong> (b. 1805 - d. 1877).
            Smith mentions hearing "Parson" Brownlow speak in Columbus on 10 December 1862.
         </p>
         <p><strong>Collins, Gilbert</strong> (b. 1831 - d. 1885-05-07).
            Lucius Smith mentions that Gill Collins went to speak at a war
            meeting in Albany on 2 August 1862. During his trips to Columbus Lucius sees Gilbert
            
            Collins on at least two occassions seeking legal aid. On 9 August 1862 Lucius visits
            Collins
            to put his property in his father's name "so that if I am drafed he can take and them
            Patent Right
            men can stand off." In December Lucius notes that he found out he found out he was
            being sued by 
            "those Patent right men" when Gilbert Collins wrote to the Clerk of the U.S. Court
            at Cleveland.  
            It is the likely that Lucius is referred to the lawyer Gilbert G. Collins who was
            later elected
            mayor of Columbus from 1879-1880. Collins lived in Plains Township with his parents,
            Andrew and
            Mary Collins until their death. He relocated to Columbus to study law 1858 and was
            admitted to 
            practice in March 1861."Collins, Gilbert G";
            "1850 United States Federal Census";
            "1860 United States Federal Census";
            "Pvt Gilbert George Collins"
                 
                                
            
         </p>
         <p><strong>Coons, John W.</strong> (b. 1834 - d. ).
            
         </p>
         <p><strong>Cox, Samuel Sullivan</strong> (b. 1824-09-30 - d. 1889-09-10).
            
            Smith mentions Samuel Cox giving a war speech, along with Cancey Olds and Sam Galaway at
            a large gathering on August 13th. It is likely that Smith is here referring to Ohio
            Democratic Congressman Samuel Sullivan Cox, who gave a number
            of speeches in central Ohio during this period.
         </p>
         <p><strong>Dague, John</strong>.
            
            On the 10th of August, 1862, Lucius went to visit John Dague to call in a promise
            Dague
            made to help Smith dig his well. However, it seems that Dague's promise came to little.
            While
            several later entries mention "John" helping Lucius with the well, the familiar usage
            of the
            name makes it much more likely that this "John" was Smith's brother, Johnathan Wesley 
            Smith.

            "US Civil War Draft Registrations Record, 1863-1865";
            
         </p>
         <p><strong>Evans, Rowland "Reece" Rowland "Roll" Evans</strong>.
            Census records indicate that there were two Rowland Evans residing in Albany in the
            1860s, possibly a nephew and uncle duo.  Presumably one of them was referred to as
            “Reece” and the other as “Roll,” but it remains unclear which was which.
         </p>
         <p><strong>Galaway, Samuel</strong> (b. 1836).
            Smith mentions Samuel Galaway as giving a war speech, along with Cancey Olds and
            Cox, Samuel at a large gathering on August 13th.
         </p>
         <p><strong>Goodrich, George Asbury</strong> (b. 1833 - d. 1903).
            George Goodrich is frequently mentioned in Smith's entries from August through December
            for helping
            Archibald Smith and Lucius Smith at the Cane House. Goodrich seems to be involved
            in chores like boiling, making and 
            cleaning pans at the Cane House. Lucius Smith and Goodrich, probably, also wanted
            to collaborate on a fur mill business 
            with Mr. Watterman from Delaware. Goodrich reportedly moves to Delware between 14th
            and 20th December of 1862. In the last
            week of December, Lucius Smith mentions writing to Goodrich in Delaware.  
         </p>
         <p><strong>Grovenbery, Garret</strong> (b. 1808 - d. ).
            Garret Grovenbery is mentioned several times throughout Smith's diary. Smith mentions
            spending the night
            at Grovenbery's on the night of August 9th and obtaining "a load of corn" from him
            in late September. Most notably, Smith borrows a horse
            from Grovenbery on September 12th to work his mill. On November 24th, he discovers
            that the horse has broken a bone in its back and  
            has to be put down. Near the end of December, Smith trades a two-year-old colt to
            Grovenbery in exchange for the dead horse and an
            additional $3.00.
         </p>
         <p><strong>Montgomery, Misses</strong>.
            
            "Misses Montgomery," identified as the sister-in-law of Lucius's uncle, Charles Beach,
            visited the Smith household twice in the course of the journal. On the 24th of November,
            she is reported as visiting with Aunt Eliza and other relatives "on their way to the
            
            Robertses" and on the 31st of November, she is reported as visiting over Sunday on
            her 
            return trip.
            
         </p>
         <p><strong>Smith, Archibald</strong> (b. 1803-09-15 - d. 1883-08).
            Lucius Clark Smith's father. L.C. Smith mentions him with great frequency throughout
            his diary, almost
            always in reference to the work the two are doing.
         </p>
         <p><strong>Smith, Archibald Homer</strong> (b. 1851 - d. ).
            Referred to as "Homer," Archibald Homer Smith is Lucius Clark Smith's brother.  Homer
            helped Lucius in setting up the mill and doing work around the property.  Lucius also
            mentions engaging in social activities, such as hunting, with Homer.
         </p>
         <p><strong>Smith, Charles Augustine</strong> (b. 1836).
            Charles "Augustine" Smith is Lucuis Smith's brother. On Sunday, August 31st 1862
            Lucius Smith states that Augustine "last week had a tower of fits getting Better."
            The other two references
            to Augustine report that he was not attendance at the Celebration Sunday School on
            August 13 or a basket 
            meeting on August 17.
            "1860 United States Federal Census"
            
         </p>
         <p><strong>Smith, Isaac Newton</strong> (b. 1824-02-16 - d. 1912-06-27).
            Lucuis Smith's brother, Isaac Newton, is frequently referered to as Newton in 
            Lucuis' diary. Most of the references to Newton in Lucius Smith's entries note the
            labor that Newton
            performs from "hawling" materials to digging the well and thrashing wheat. Census
            records indicate that
            Isaac Newton Smith married and relocated to Blendon, Ohio by 1900 and identified his
            occupation as a 
            physician. "1900 United States Federal Census"
            
         </p>
         <p><strong>Smith, Johnathan Wesley</strong> (b. 1838-08-16 - d. ).
            
            John is Lucius Smith's second younger brother. Lucius refers to him throughout the
            journal, commonly 
            in reference to labor shared by the brothers on family farm. John was particularly
            noted as helping 
            Lucius with the labor on his well and his Mill. In the week of August 23rd 1862, Lucius
            also mentions 
            that John was considering enlisting in the company that was presently raising, but
            expressed doubt
            that he would actually commit. However, Lucius's prediction proved wrong within a
            year, as John and 
            brother Newton both enlisted in June of 1863.

         </p>
         <p><strong>Smith, Lucius Clark</strong> (b. 1834-11-24).
            Archibald Smith's oldest son
         </p>
         <p><strong>Smith, Samuel</strong> (b. 1838 - d. ).
            Lucius Smith mentions Samuel Smith twice in his diary: first, in reference to a visit
            he makes with his
            (Samuel's) mother on August 27th and second, in reference to a letter that Lucius
            writes to him on September 7th. There isn't any 
            evidence that Samuel is a direct relation, but his occupation as a plow maker may
            explain Lucius's connection to him.
         </p>
         <p><strong>Wells, Eliza (nee Beach)</strong> (b. 1804 - d. ).
            Lucius Clark Smith's aunt, the sister of his mother, married to Thornton Wells, mother
            to son of the same name.  A frequent visitor the Smith household in Albany, particularly
            on her way to and from Columbus.  She also hosted Lucius at her home in Liberty (Licking
            County) on numerous occassions.
         </p>
         <p><strong>Wells, Thornton E. B.</strong> (b.  - d. 1869).
            Lucius Smith's cousin. Son of Eliza Wells (nee Beach), Lucius Smith's mother's sister.
            He stops by 
            Smith's house in Albany while traveling to and from Columbus. He often helps Smith
            with cutting and hawling of wood.
         </p>
         <p><strong>Wilson, George</strong>.
             In the entry dated 24th August 1862, Lucius Smith mentions that George Wilson is
            one of the few people 
            who have been discharged from the army. Smith also mentions visiting Wilson's house
            quite a few times in August and 
            December. Wilson helps Smith with grinding and looking after the "little boyes" who
            work at the mill.

            John L. Gill, Sr. was a Columbus Tinner and one of the founding partners of the
            Franklin Foundry. Gill took over sole proprietorship in 1852, then associated his
            son
            with the business in 1857, taking the name "John L. Gill and Son" for the business.
            The
            foundry was a major metal casting concern in Columbus in the 1850's and 1860's, specializing
            in farm mechanism such as plows, mills and harvesters.
            However, "John L. Gill and Son" is also a name associated specifically with sorghum
            production
            in Ohio, being mentioned both in the first "Report of the Commissioner of Agriculture"
            to 
            Congress in 1862 and the Ohio State Department of Agriculture report of the same year.
            While
            both Gill Jr. and Sr. were both active in this aspect of the family business - both
            are
            mentioned in the Sorgo Journal and Farm Machinist of 1865 - John L. Gill, Jr., the
            
            eponymous "and Son," seemed to have taken a more active role, being both the Secretary
            of
            1862 and 1865 Ohio Sorghum Convention and appointed to a committee "to correspond
            with or visit
            the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, and secure, if possible, some mitigation of
            the duty
            proposed to be assessed on Sorghum."
            Nor were the Gills slow to capitalize on the advantage that their duel family businesses
            provided.
            In the 1862 Ohio Cultivator, Gill Jr. responds to criticism that the Ohio Sorghum
            Convention, 
            of which he was the Secretary, was monopolized by "the inventors, manufacturers and
            agents of Mills
            and Evaporators, and was made an advertising medium" for them.

            United States; Ohio (Lat/Long: 
            39.1500 -84.4500). 
            Several times throughout September, Smith mentions Cincinnati in reference to the
            events transpiring
            there. On the week ending September 6th, Smith mentions that the Rebels under General
            Smith are advancing 
            onto the city and that it has been put under martial law, along with neighboring towns.
            On the 12th, he
            writes that thousands of people are going to Cincinnati to defend it, taking theirs
            guns, etc., and that 
            the governor is already refusing people. Finally, on the week ending September 20th,
            Smith writes that
            Cincinnati has been saved after "some of the severest fiting of the war." The trajectory
            of these events 
            describes what has come to be known as the Defense of Cincinnati, about which the
            Editorial Introduction 
            includes additional information.
